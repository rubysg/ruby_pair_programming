## About the Ruby Pair Programming Session
- It's a 3 hour guided session for people at all levels: beginner, intermediate or expert
- You team up with someone else and take turns writing tests and code
- The objective of this session is to learn during the process. Don't fret if at the end of the day you find that you haven't achieved anything "productive"
- Ruby, Ruby, Ruby - it's okay to dabble with other technologies, e.g., Javascript :) but please focus on using Ruby as the primary language. But Ruby doesn't just mean Rails. Feel free to work on a script, start a gem, hack on a Sinatra app, etc
- Use Test Driven Development if you can (or at least have tests in place). Despite what some people think, we've found that TDD works well in most circumstances
- Different people will use different tools (editors, test frameworks, etc). You might be unfamiliar with your pair's setup, but take this as a chance to learn something new. Maybe you will like what you see!
- Pair programming doesn't strictly have to be pairs. If !n.modulo(2).zero? we can have a triplet group

## What to Bring

Your laptop with Ruby and a test framework installed (Minitest comes with Ruby; many Ruby devs prefer RSpec). Your favourite editor. An open mind.

Sample templates are available for [minitest](https://github.com/rubysg/minitest_template) and [RSpec](https://github.com/rubysg/rspec_simple_template).

If you don't know where to start, don't worry. We can help you install Ruby and set up your laptop at the session.

We'll provide power, desks, air-conditioning and WiFi. And hopefully an enjoyable morning of coding.

## Programme

After an introduction to the session and a demo, we'll help set up the pairings and start working on a simple coding assignment. At the end of the session, we'll have a huddle and discuss what we learned during the session.
